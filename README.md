# NextRoute
## Overview
NextRoute is a website designed to highlight my web development skills as a full stack engineer. NextRoute allows rock climbers to find routes, create routes, and review routes. The reason I choose to build a rock climbing website was to build something that was intuitive for users. As a frequent user of mountainproject and alltrails, I enjoy those websites, but often find them a little tricky to navigate.

## Technologies Used
This project employs the following technology:
- Django Framework
- AWS (for image upload)
- Base CSS (No CSS frameworks were used)
- HTML
- Heroku Deployment
- Javascript
## Key Takeaways
This website enabled me to practice my base CSS skills some more and allowed me to further explore the authentication aspect of the Django framework.
## Future Ideas
For context, this website is part of my capstone project for General Assembly's 6-month coding program. Whether I will continue this project after the program is over is TBD. However, I had a couple of ideas for adding to the project, including:
- adding a like feature to reviews.
- Implementing google maps API to help users pinpoint the rock climbing location exactly.
- Adding the ability to have admin who can monitor the website and alter content deemed inappropriate.
- Additional authentication measures to the app.
## Challenges
Initially this project started as the_climbers_route (which is also on my github page). That project was built using Django React, but after some inital issues, I decided to start over with base Django and focus on making a tightly run app.
