# NextRoute
## Overview
NextRoute is a website I built with two goals in mind. One, I wanted to highight my app building skills for prospect employers. Two, I wanted to build something unique so I went with a community-driven website that allows users to post rock climbing routes, allow users to find new routes to climb, and to allow users to post a review of a particular route.

## Technologies Used
This project employs the following technology:
- Django Framework
- AWS (for image upload)
- Base CSS (While base CSS takes longer to work with, I enjoy the freedom/flexbility it offers when styling websites).
- HTML
- Heroku Deployment
- Javascript
## Key Takeaways
This website helped me grow in a few ways:
- Further practice on my CSS
- Better understanding of Django's authentication
- Working with the backend side of Django.
## Future Ideas
For context, this website is part of my capstone project for General Assembly's 6-month coding program. Whether I will continue this project after the program is over is TBD. However, I had a couple of ideas for adding to the project, including:
- adding a like feature to reviews.
- Implementing google maps API to help users pinpoint the rock climbing location exactly.
- Adding the ability to have admin who can monitor the website and alter content deemed inappropriate.
- Additional authentication measures to the app.
## Challenges
Initially this project started as the_climbers_route (which is also on my github page). That project was built using Django React, but after some inital issues, I decided to start over with base Django and focus on making a fully functional app given this project needed to be done in 3 weeks. So, the challenge was having to start over after 10 days.
